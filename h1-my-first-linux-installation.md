## Main Principles of Writing a Report (by Tero Karvinen) ##
- Write the report as you work — describe exactly what you did and what happened; writing clarifies your thoughts and helps repeat the work later.
- The report must be repeatable — another person should be able to get the same results in the same environment; describe the hardware, software, and setting precisely.
- Be precise — include commands, clicks, timestamps, and results; report both successes and failures, and use the past tense.
- Make it easy to read — use subheadings and clear language; adjust your style to the medium and optionally start with a short summary paragraph.
- Cite your sources properly — references demonstrate familiarity with the subject and add credibility; use a consistent citation format.
- Use standard texts and a license — for example, include the GNU GPL notice and mention the original source when appropriate.
- Avoid serious mistakes — do not fabricate results, plagiarize text, or use unauthorized images; always credit sources and respect copyright.
## The setup with the Virtualbox ##
When starting this assingment, the first step was installing Oracle's Virtualbox to my PC and then creating the following virtual machine in the program:

Prior to this course, I had hardly any experience with virtual computers and none with Linux. That's why this part of the process took me quite a long time, atleast two hours. I really had only one problem at the start. When I tried to boot up the virtual machine, it said that I couldn't boot up the machine because the system was in 32 mode but this was a mistake on my part. I got it fixed by creating another virtual machine.

## Linux installation ##
Once again, the installation inside the virtual machine went well because the instructions on the universitycourses website were so good and detailed:

In the end, the operating system rebooted once the installation was finished. Now when the Linux loaded up, I went to the login screen and after that I got in to the system with the login credentials that I had created earlier:

## Cowsay ##
As a bonus assingment, I tried to install Cowsay program to Debian. Then I ran to this error which I couldn't find the information online on how to fix since I was running out of time on the deadline of the assingment. Better luck next time!
