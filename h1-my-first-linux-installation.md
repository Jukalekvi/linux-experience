# h1 my first Linux installation

## The setup with the Virtualbox
When starting this assingment, the first step was installing Oracle's Virtualbox to my PC and then creating the following virtual machine in the program:

Prior to this course, I had hardly any experience with virtual computers and none with Linux. That's why this part of the process took me quite a long time, atleast two hours. I really had only one problem at the start. When I tried to boot up the virtual machine, it said that I couldn't boot up the machine because the system was in 32 mode but this was a mistake on my part. I got it fixed by creating another virtual machine.

## Linux installation
Once again, the installation inside the virtual machine went well because the instructions on the universitycourses website were so good and detailed.

In the end, the operating system rebooted once the installation was finished. Now when the Linux loaded up, I went to the login screen and after that I got in to the system with the login credentials that I had created earlier.

## Cowsay
As a bonus assingment, I tried to install Cowsay program to Debian. Then I ran to this error which I couldn't find the information online on how to fix since I was running out of time on the deadline of the assingment. Better luck next time!
